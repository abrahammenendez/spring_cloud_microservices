**What is this?**

The complete webapp I made for Sergey Kargopolov's course [Spring Boot Microservices with Spring Cloud](https://www.udemy.com/course/spring-boot-microservices-and-spring-cloud/).

**What did I learn?**

Building microservices with:
- Eureka Discovery Service
- Zuul API Gateway
- Load Balancing
- Spring Cloud Bus
- Spring Boot Actuator
- Rabbit MQ
- Spring Cloud Sleuth and Zipkin
- Spring Security
- Spring Cloud Config Server
- ELK stack

I also deployed them in Docker containers on multiple EC2 Linux machines.

**How was the course?**

I have used some of the tech teached in this course, but I feel like I learned a lot anyways.

**Additional info**

For the past six years I've taken a lot of courses in my free time. Sadly, I never thought about compiling them into a list. Since 2019, I've been trying to write down (and rate) every new course I take. You can see it [here](https://github.com/abrahammenendez/courses/).
